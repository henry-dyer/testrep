This repository contains the files for APPM 4600 Lab 1 and the APPM 4600 HW1

It is set up in the following way:

testrep
   |-->HW1-->4600 HW1
   |-->Lab 1-->4600lab1.py

The rest of this readme is simply to make sure I meet the five hundred character limit for the Applied Mathematics class 
4600 (Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing) for the Spring 2024 semester.
